Project for Computação Gráfica in IST by Eduardo Lobo, Inês Ji and Raquel Cardoso.
This project is composed of three parts that involve various aspects of graphic computation, specifically focusing on technical drawing, 3D modeling, lighting and textures in Three.js. Each part explores different concepts and techniques in the field.
The details of each part are as follows:

Part 1: Technical Drawing
This part emphasizes technical drawing techniques. It involves tasks such as line drawing, shape creation, and geometric transformations. The goal is to apply these techniques to create accurate and visually appealing technical drawings.

Part 2: 3D Modeling in Three.js [OPTIMUS PRIME] 
In this part, you will delve into 3D modeling using the Three.js library. You will learn how to create and manipulate 3D models, define materials and textures, and apply lighting effects to enhance the visual realism of the scene.

Part 3: Lighting and Textures in Three.js [UFO]
Part 3 is dedicated to exploring lighting and textures in Three.js. You will learn different lighting techniques such as ambient, directional, and point lighting, as well as shadow mapping. Additionally, you will explore texture mapping to add realistic surface details to 3D models.
